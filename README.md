## University practice on the subject "Parallel programming basics"

### Warning

I'm archive this repository for the sake of memories. Code style may differ
from practice to practice, because I experimented with it. Some fragments contains pretty weak realization, but it's not a point of the
current subject.

### Abstract description:

#### Practice №1
* POSIX Threads basics.
* Programming of independent threads.

#### Practice №2
* Programming of threads with synchronization.
* Simple MapReduce implementation.
* Simple parallel substring search in a selected directory.

#### Practice №3
* OpenMP basics.
* OMP modification for the Mandelbrot set parallel computation.

#### Practice №4
* MPI basics.
* Sequential and MPI implementation of the Jacobi method.

#### Practice №5
* OpenCL path tracing based on following tutorial:
